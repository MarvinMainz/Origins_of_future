# Origins_of_future
a small project compiling data on the development of future tense. Contains both data and writings belonging the project.

Starting with the visualizations:

1) OF_map.png roughly maps the 115 languages in the collection, coloured depending on their family which is given accordingly in the legend.

2) semantic_map_reduced.png is not a real semantic map, but rather a simple diagram synopsis of the development of the primary and modality-based futures described in Bybee et al. 1994 and Kuteva et al. 2019.
Each arrow as well as the curly bracket represent a semantic development, whereas the labels inbetween represent the states. The length or width of the arrows is not of any significance.

3) semantic_map.png is more a real semantic map. The more the space is colored red the more grammatical are the features in it (roughly). The grey background is to represent the semantic cluster of directional elements.
As such, the length of the arrows here has some meaning, however, the semantic space presented is still not mathematically correct in any way (distances could not be used for any operation).
The dotted arrows describe suggested developments, whereas continuous arrows represent attested developments.
Dotted circles represent semantic fields.
The dotted or dashed rectangles represent verbal categories, each dotted/dashed in its own fashion.

Words in green represent lexical concepts, words in yellow represent (non-grammatical) semantic abstractions, words in CAPS represent grammatical concepts. Words in lower case without any coloring represent concepts whose status in terms of abstraction and grammaticality is unclear.
